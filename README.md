🔋 Machine Learning Based State of Charge (SOC) Prediction for Battery Management System

📌 Overview

This project focuses on estimating the State of Charge (SOC) of a lithium-ion battery using Machine Learning techniques. SOC represents the remaining battery capacity in percentage and is a critical parameter in Battery Management Systems (BMS) used in electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and portable electronics.
Traditional SOC estimation methods such as Coulomb Counting and Open Circuit Voltage suffer from accumulated errors and limited accuracy. This project uses a data-driven ML approach to improve SOC prediction accuracy.
